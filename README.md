## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was a long-time web designer from 2002 - 2016. I saw the web grow up literally in real-time over the years.

I have since been focusing on front-end engineering and full-stack development. I found that I have even more passion for development and engineering than simply just design.

AV Labs is a place for me to share my projects and info for potential clients/employers. I am actively looking for work, freelance, contract, or a permanent position.

Please feel free to contact me at my email: aaronvarga@aol.com

I am always up for open-source projects with anyone wanting to collaborate and maybe do some pair programming, etc.

I look forward to connecting with many more people from the dev community.

Best wishes!

- A-a-ron
