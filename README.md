## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on multiple front-end projects including a front-end development education platform.

I was a long-time web designer from 2002 - 2011. I saw the web grow up literally in real-time over the years.

I have since been focusing on front-end engineering and full-stack development. I found that I have even more passion for development and engineering than simply just design.

**I am actively looking for work, freelance, contract, or a permanent position**. Please feel free to contact me regarding any opportunities or your next project idea!

I look forward to connecting with many more people from the dev community.

Best wishes!

A-a-ron
